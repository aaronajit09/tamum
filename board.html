                <p class="role">Co-President (M2)</p>
                <p>My name is Angeline, and I'm an M2 at the Round Rock campus. I plan to pursue OB/GYN and am drawn to medicine as a means of advancing social justice, particularly through advocating for abortion access and challenging the oppressive systems that perpetuate health inequities. I'm also passionate about narrative medicine and gender-affirming care. MSFC has given me an incredible community of peers and mentors who remind me why this work matters, and I am so grateful to be part of such a supportive and inspiring group.</p>

                <p>I am a third-year medical student at the EnMed Houston campus and am still exploring which specialty I would like to pursue. I am particularly interested in a field that allows me to focus on longitudinal patient care. I am passionate about advocating for patients' rights, especially in the area of reproductive healthcare. MSFC has provided me with an invaluable opportunity to explore different ways to engage in advocacy as a medical student and, in the future, as a physician. I look forward to leading our chapter this year alongside our other co-president, Angeline Ajit, and to creating meaningful learning and advocacy opportunities for fellow medical students.</p>
